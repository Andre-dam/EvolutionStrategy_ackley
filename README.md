# EvolutionStrategy_ackley
Evolution Strategies (ESs) are a sub-class of nature-inspired direct search (and optimization) methods belonging to the class of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) which use mutation, recombination, and selection applied to a population of individuals containing candidate solutions in order to evolve iteratively better and better solutions. Evolution Strategies can be applied in all fields of optimization including continuous, discrete, combinatorial search spaces Y without and with constraints as well as mixed search spaces.

The Ackley function is widely used for testing optimization algorithms. In its two-dimensional form, as shown in the plot above, it is characterized by a nearly flat outer region, and a large hole at the centre. The function poses a risk for optimization algorithms, particularly hillclimbing algorithms, to be trapped in one of its many local minima
